    print("Game started!")

func add_score(points):
    score += points
    print("Score: ", score)`

**Expected Outcome:**

## üîÑ **5. Workflow Integration Tests**

### Test: Complete Game Object Creation
**Prompt:** `Create a complete player setup: make a new scene called "Player", add a CharacterBody2D node called "PlayerBody", add a Sprite2D child called "PlayerSprite", and create a player controller script at "res://scripts/player_controller.gd" attached to PlayerBody`

- All successful operations reflect in Godot editor immediately
- Error cases handled gracefully with clear messages
- File system operations create proper directory structures
- Node hierarchy matches requests exactly
- Scripts attach correctly and contain expected content

**üîç Verification Steps:**
1. Watch Godot Scene dock for node changes
2. Check Godot FileSystem dock for new files/folders  
3. Open created scripts in Godot to verify content

## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Connection Problems
- **Symptom**: "Cannot connect to Godot plugin"
- **Check**: Godot running? Plugin enabled? HTTP server on port 8080?
- **Fix**: Restart Godot, re-enable plugin, check console for errors

### Scene Operations Fail
- **Symptom**: Scene creation/opening fails
- **Check**: File permissions? Valid paths? Godot project open?
- **Fix**: Ensure Godot project is open and file system is writable

### Node Addition Fails  
- **Symptom**: Nodes not appearing in scene
- **Check**: Scene currently open? Valid node type? Parent exists?
- **Fix**: Open a scene first, use supported node types

### Script Creation Issues
- **Symptom**: Scripts not created or attached
- **Check**: Valid file paths? Directory permissions? Node exists for attachment?
- **Fix**: Use `res://` paths, ensure target nodes exist
