## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Connection Problems
- **Symptom**: "Cannot connect to Godot plugin"
- **Check**: Godot running? Plugin enabled? HTTP server on port 8080?
- **Fix**: Restart Godot, re-enable plugin, check console for errors

### Scene Operations Fail
- **Symptom**: Scene creation/opening fails
- **Check**: File permissions? Valid paths? Godot project open?
- **Fix**: Ensure Godot project is open and file system is writable

### Node Addition Fails  
- **Symptom**: Nodes not appearing in scene
- **Check**: Scene currently open? Valid node type? Parent exists?
- **Fix**: Open a scene first, use supported node types

### Script Creation Issues
- **Symptom**: Scripts not created or attached
- **Check**: Valid file paths? Directory permissions? Node exists for attachment?
- **Fix**: Use `res://` paths, ensure target nodes exist
